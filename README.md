# QR Code Generator

Generate QR Codes from any text or URL in black and white or custom color schemes.

This website was built using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. It uses the [QR Code API](https://goqr.me/api/).

#### Best Practices for QR codes:

- Make sure the color-contrast is sufficient and the main color is darker than the background color.

- Longer texts or URLS (over 300 characters) may cause issues with older scanners.
